% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
\usepackage{fancyvrb,enumerate}
\usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
\usepackage{here}
\usepackage{caption}

%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.




% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  % The IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
  \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
\else
  % normal IEEE
  \usepackage{cite}

\fi
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later.





% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage{acronym}
% acronym.sty was written by Tobias Oetiker. This package provides tools for
% managing documents with large numbers of acronyms. (You don't *have* to
% use this package - unless you have a lot of acronyms, you may feel that
% such package management of them is bit of an overkill.)
% Do note that the acronym environment (which lists acronyms) will have a
% problem when used under IEEEtran.cls because acronym.sty relies on the
% description list environment - which IEEEtran.cls has customized for
% producing IEEE style lists. A workaround is to declared the longest
% label width via the IEEEtran.cls \IEEEiedlistdecl global control:
%
% \renewcommand{\IEEEiedlistdecl}{\IEEEsetlabelwidth{SONET}}
% \begin{acronym}
%
% \end{acronym}
% \renewcommand{\IEEEiedlistdecl}{\relax}% remember to reset \IEEEiedlistdecl
%
% instead of using the acronym environment's optional argument.
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/acronym


%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/mdwtools


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/eqparbox




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a sans serif font rather
% than the serif font used in traditional IEEE formatting and thus the need
% to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending on whether
% compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier doble column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.


% NOTE: PDF thumbnail features are not required in IEEE papers
%       and their use requires extra complexity and work.
%\ifCLASSINFOpdf
%  \usepackage[pdftex]{thumbpdf}
%\else
%  \usepackage[dvips]{thumbpdf}
%\fi
% thumbpdf.sty and its companion Perl utility were written by Heiko Oberdiek.
% It allows the user a way to produce PDF documents that contain fancy
% thumbnail images of each of the pages (which tools like acrobat reader can
% utilize). This is possible even when using dvi->ps->pdf workflow if the
% correct thumbpdf driver options are used. thumbpdf.sty incorporates the
% file containing the PDF thumbnail information (filename.tpm is used with
% dvips, filename.tpt is used with pdftex, where filename is the base name of
% your tex document) into the final ps or pdf output document. An external
% utility, the thumbpdf *Perl script* is needed to make these .tpm or .tpt
% thumbnail files from a .ps or .pdf version of the document (which obviously
% does not yet contain pdf thumbnails). Thus, one does a:
% 
% thumbpdf filename.pdf 
%
% to make a filename.tpt, and:
%
% thumbpdf --mode dvips filename.ps
%
% to make a filename.tpm which will then be loaded into the document by
% thumbpdf.sty the NEXT time the document is compiled (by pdflatex or
% latex->dvips->ps2pdf). Users must be careful to regenerate the .tpt and/or
% .tpm files if the main document changes and then to recompile the
% document to incorporate the revised thumbnails to ensure that thumbnails
% match the actual pages. It is easy to forget to do this!
% 
% Unix systems come with a Perl interpreter. However, MS Windows users
% will usually have to install a Perl interpreter so that the thumbpdf
% script can be run. The Ghostscript PS/PDF interpreter is also required.
% See the thumbpdf docs for details. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at.
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/thumbpdf


% NOTE: PDF hyperlink and bookmark features are not required in IEEE
%       papers and their use requires extra complexity and work.

%\usepackage{breakurl}
%\fi
% One significant drawback of using hyperref under DVI output is that the
% LaTeX compiler cannot break URLs across lines or pages as can be done
% under pdfLaTeX's PDF output via the hyperref pdftex driver. This is
% probably the single most important capability distinction between the
% DVI and PDF output. Perhaps surprisingly, all the other PDF features
% (PDF bookmarks, thumbnails, etc.) can be preserved in
% .tex->.dvi->.ps->.pdf workflow if the respective packages/scripts are
% loaded/invoked with the correct driver options (dvips, etc.). 
% As most IEEE papers use URLs sparingly (mainly in the references), this
% may not be as big an issue as with other publications.
%
% That said, Vilar Camara Neto created his breakurl.sty package which
% permits hyperref to easily break URLs even in dvi mode.
% Note that breakurl, unlike most other packages, must be loaded
% AFTER hyperref. The latest version of breakurl and its documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/breakurl
% breakurl.sty is not for use under pdflatex pdf mode.
%
% The advanced features offer by hyperref.sty are not required for IEEE
% submission, so users should weigh these features against the added
% complexity of use.
% The package options above demonstrate how to enable PDF bookmarks
% (a type of table of contents viewable in Acrobat Reader) as well as
% PDF document information (title, subject, author and keywords) that is
% viewable in Acrobat reader's Document_Properties menu. PDF document
% information is also used extensively to automate the cataloging of PDF
% documents. The above set of options ensures that hyperlinks will not be
% colored in the text and thus will not be visible in the printed page,
% but will be active on "mouse over". USING COLORS OR OTHER HIGHLIGHTING
% OF HYPERLINKS CAN RESULT IN DOCUMENT REJECTION BY THE IEEE, especially if
% these appear on the "printed" page. IF IN DOUBT, ASK THE RELEVANT
% SUBMISSION EDITOR. You may need to add the option hypertexnames=false if
% you used duplicate equation numbers, etc., but this should not be needed
% in normal IEEE work.
% The latest version of hyperref and its documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/hyperref





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.

\begin{abstract}This electronic document is a description of Educator for Korean Sign-language operated by leap-motion device. In nowadays concern for disabled has been increased. Therefore lots of people wants learn sign language which can be bridge between handicapped and un-handicapped. However, learning sign language can be troublesome. It can cost lots of money and time. To overcome this problem, there are lots of program to help people learn sign language. Problem is that these programs are mostly English, and does not support Korean. Lots of people believe that sign language is same for all around the world, but that is not true. Korean and English in terms of sign language are very different. So, we invented KASLE, which means “Korean Adapted Sign-Language Education for beginner.” This program uses hardware called Leap-motion which recognizes hand motions. It will compare hand motion and data in the store to guess it is correct. One of the key features of our program is machine learning. By using famous machine learning language SVM, we are going to teach program how to understand this motion. Also, we are going to add some game to help user have fun during study. There are functionality that user can add or delete word in program by using gestures. This function will help user contribute to our program. Our program will help people who use Korean to learn sign language efficiently.

Especially, efforts to break wall between the un-handicapped and the handicapped are continued until these days. As one of that kinds of efforts, the most frequently used way to communicate with deaf is sign language. Some people who are not handicapped also want to learn sign language. However, lots of people who want to study sign language realize that sign language is very difficult. Even if they want to practice sign language there are not enough ways to practice it. Of course, there are some ways to be educated by associated institution or professional educator. However it cost too much in time and money. Also, there are some programs for educating sign language in English, but there are not many programs for Korean. To overcome these problems we made program that people can see, imitate and correcting sign language while learning. This program was made by using LeapMotion which recognize finger’s motion.\\

\subsection{Recognizing hand movement\\}




\subsubsection{Get hand data Using LeapMotion hardware}

In LeapMotion, there is a function that collects user’s hand data. So by using this function we can see what kind of data is implemented about movement. 
We can use this data to use other thing, for example as recognize gesture or determine if gesture is correct or not.
\\Input – Person's Hand gesture.
\\Implementation process : While user is gesturing, Leap motion captures its shape or movement and recognizes it as corresponding gesture. Leap motion SDK converts data into user understandable form and show it to us.
\\Output :Hand data
\subsubsection{Using data from LeapMotion and machine learning algorithm, program learn about sign-language gestures.}

Nowadays machine learning has become most important thing in software. So we are going to use machine learning to improve our accuracy. by using SVM we can teach our program a machine learning and it can improve our program’s accuracy.
\\Input: Person's Hand data
\\Implementation process: Analyzing given sets of hand data, SVM(machine learning algorithm) learns rules that separate each gesture. So, algorithm itself performs classification on hand data comparing with existing rule based on given past data set.
Output: SVM algorithm with gesture classification rule.
\\Implementation process : While user is gesturing, Leap motion captures its shape or movement and recognizes it as corresponding gesture. Leap motion SDK converts data into user understandable form and show it to us.
\\Output :Hand data
\subsubsection{From the data that program learned, program recognize sign language from current hand movement.}

LeapMotion can collect hand data. So, using our LeapMotion SDK we can add gesture. by comparing gesture data and user hand movement, program can determine whether user is doing correct gesture or not. Also, by using machine learning program can evolve our program so it can recognize sign language better.
\\Input : Person's Hand gesture
\\Implementation process: For each gesture, Leap motion hardware classifies and recognizes each gesture using SVM algorithm generated by past hand data set. In other words, machine learning algorithm determines what kind of gesture this is. Leap motion SDK receive the data from \\Leap motion hardware and processed by SVM algorithm. And it converts the raw data into user-understandable data and shows to us.
\\Output : Recognized Sign language and its result in user understandable form.

\subsection{Functions for sign-language educator.\\}


\subsubsection{Recognizing basic vowel for sign-language.}

We input a basic vowel for basic sign-language communication. User can use vowel for using unregistered word. It is a kind of finger language. Frankly we have a weak point that can`t realize all sign-language because sign-language sometimes use not only all part of arm but also chest so there is hardware-wise problem. For the sake of overcoming this problem, we add this requirement.
\\Input – Person's Hand gesture(vowel)
\\Implementation process:
\\(First time) We tell program that current hand data set represents specific vowel. And the program stores that data set into program.
\\(After specific vowel is stored to program) Program recognizes that user’s gesture represents vowel.
\\Output – Program data represents vowel.

\subsubsection{Recognizing basic consonant for sign-language.}

We input a basic consonant for basic sign-language communication. User can use consonant for using unregistered word. it is a kind of finger language. Frankly we have a weak point that can`t realize all sign-language because sign-language sometimes use not only all part of arm but also chest so there is hardware-wise problem. For the sake of overcoming this problem, we add this requirement.
\\Input – Person's Hand Gesture(consonant)
\\Implementation process:
\\(First time) We tell program that current hand data set represents specific consonant. And the program stores that data set into program.
\\(After specific consonant is stored to program) Program recognizes that user’s gesture represents consonant.
\\Output – Program data that represents consonant.

\subsubsection{Making a complete character using registered vowel and consonant.}

This requirement is associated requirement number 2 and 3. We already explain why we add default vowel and consonant. Consequently requirement number 2 and 3 is for this requirement. If user want to communicate others people by finger language, user must be able to make complete letter so we offer this function.
\\Input –Program's data represents consonant and vowel.
\\Implementation process:
\\Program combines vowel and consonant into character and makes word with characters.
\\(After specific consonant is stored to program) Program recognizes that user’s gesture represents consonant.
\\Output – Program data(word).

\subsubsection{Registering the basic words for sign-language.}

We offer basic sign-language words. For user convenience, we offer various built in words, user can use it without data entry. Because of our hardware-wise problem we support only basic (not that many) words for user.
\\Implementation process:  Basic words’ sign 
\\language recognition features is provided by program. It is implemented by data entry by developers during developing process.
\\Output: Built-in words that are not needed to be entered by user.

\subsubsection{Practice game for letters and words.}

Humans are interested in a kind of games and have more concentration when they`re plying game so we offer a simple game for practicing sign-language it maybe shows some word question by Korean and user makes correct sign-language in response to question then game shows correct sign or incorrect sign.
\\Input: Person's Hand gesture
\\lImplementation process : Program recognizes user’s gesture and compare with current questions’ sign language gesture in game. It also shows whether user’s answer is correct or not.
\\Output: Sign language game and result page with rate of questions to which user answers correctly and questions provided by program


\subsubsection{Extracting entered words to text file.}

It is important to extracting sentence user want to say because our program maybe offer various function that bases on extracting text file. In other word this function is basic condition for other functions.
\\Input: Entered character(s) or word(s).
\\lImplementation process : Program recognizes each word and convert to and save in text file.
\\Output: Text file

\subsubsection{ Posting text entered by hand movement to Social Network Service.}

In nowadays Social Network Service has become one of most important thing in today’s internet. By transferring text data to Social Network Service, we can satisfy demand who wants share their work to Social Network Service.
\\Input: Entered word
\\lImplementation process :  By selecting SNS  to which user want to upload the text and pressing button, the data is transferred to certain SNS site and shared on site. That is, user can unload text entered as gesture through leap motion hardware to Facebook.
\\Output: Uploaded text on SNS

\subsubsection{ Translation to another language using google translation API.}

User can obtain text so we offer some function using and processing text file. If you want to translate a Korean to another language, enter Google translator and enter your text. Above stages are too annoying. So we offer a translation feature using Google translator API.
\\Input: Entered word
\\lImplementation process :  By pressing ‘Translate’ , translated message is provided to user.
\\Output: Translated message.

\subsubsection{ User can register the new words.}

We add function that user can add new words by saving gesture to the program. Leap motion can recognize our gesture so user can easily gesture and save gesture to the program.
\\Input:  User’s hand gesture.
\\lImplementation process :   While user is gesturing, Leap motion captures its shape or movement and analyzes it and learns what that means by matching the hand data set and user’s input that tells what certain gesture means to program. Once it is correctly learned by program, it is saved and can be retrieved later.
\\Output: User defined data (hand data and meaning data corresponds to certain hand data)

\subsubsection{ User can delete a registered word that not correct.}

We added function that user can register word. However this approach can cause incorrect register in program. So, we added function that user can delete and fix registered word to overcome this problem.
\\Input:  Text data.
\\lImplementation process :   By using function that is created based on Leap motion SDK, user can delete words which were existed in program,.
\\Output:  Data deletion.

\subsection{Condition for program.\\}

\subsubsection{Convenient intuitive user interface.}

Users can operate our program easily without complicate explanation. They can recognize what they can do on our program. And they can easily find out how to run all the features. All of features are visualized to be found easily and understood directly.
\\For implementing this requirement developers will use ‘Java Play Framework’. By using it, we can create UI which fits well with program's overall design. As a conclusion, UI should be comfortable for user to use program.

\subsubsection{Separating user mode by normal user and manager.}
In our program only manager can add the sign language. So we need to prevent users to add sign language because it can create confusion. To separate user mode and manager mode our program has the administrator login so only manager can become administrator. In administrator mode, we can add sign language.
\\Input:   ID and Password.
\\lImplementation process :  User will input id and password in the login section. Program determines whether current user is administrator or not. If the user is administrator, program will grant user more authority to him(or her).
\\Output:   User authority level.

\subsubsection{ Constructing a simple graphic user interface(GUI).}
Lots of current program is using GUI, because it is user friendly. Of course, we can build Also, most of current users are familiar with GUI not with CLI.  So building simple GUI is essential. We are going to build GUI by using OpenGL. In this GUI there will be selection of our functions, for example where users can practice sign language and where they can test their ability.

\subsubsection{ Adding the explanation file (ex-Readme) for unexperienced computing user.}
Our program is focusing on the people who are trying to learn sign language, not computer expert. So, there is a high possibility that some people are not good at using computers. Therefore we need explanation for un-experienced users so they can use our program in efficient and effective way. We will put detailed information about program, and also contact information for more questions.

\subsubsection{ Existing communication channel for repair and additional function between user and administer.}
Our program may have some issues or bugs in program. Also user might have some idea that can improve our program. So we are going to notify user by making official SNS or email or contact number. Users can see our contact list in the program. Also if same questions were asked many times, we will add that list to our FAQ (frequently asked question).

\subsection{Choice of software development platform}

\subsubsection{System Platform(e.g., Windows, Linux, Web, or etc.)}

We chose Windows platform. All the developers have development environment which runs on Windows system. By choosing Windows system, we can save time and effort to adapt different development platform and focus on development itself.

\subsubsection{Programming Language}

Leap motion supports several (not that many) programming languages for developer. Among those options, developers chose Java. Because Java is high-level language, so developers don’t have to care about annoying physical and low-level issues. Also, it is easy to fine open source code written on Java, because of its popularity.

\subsubsection{Cost Estimation}

We spent 100 dollars to buy Leap Motion device. Except that, we will use hardware and software that were already equipped. So, our total cost will be 100 dollars.

\subsubsection{Get hand data Using LeapMotion hardware\\}
In LeapMotion, there is a function that collects user’s hand data. So by using this function we can see what kind of data is implemented about movement. We can use this data to use other thing, for example as recognize gesture or determine if gesture is correct or not.
Sign language has two categories. One is real sign language which contains hand movement and represents one or more word(s) with meaning. Second one is simple finger language without hand movement and represents single vowel or consonant. Each category of sign language has separate way to be represented by LeapMotion.
\\Input: Person's Hand gesture.
\\Implementation process: While user is gesturing, Leap motion captures its shape or movement and recognizes it as corresponding gesture. Leap motion SDK converts data into user understandable form and show it to us.
\\Output: Hand data
\\Source code 1) Get hand data which represents real sign language (dynamic hand data which contains movement)\\
Source code 2) Get hand data which represents simple finger language (static hand data without hand movement)\\

This module receives hand data samples from leap motion control module. (Each hand data sample represents hand data status of each moment.) By combining and analyzing plenty of samples (using SVM machine learning algorithm), delicately refined hand data set is generated. Developer can assign this well-defined hand data to corresponding sign language.
\\(without refining process of SVM algorithm, accuracy of recognition drops sharply.

\subsection{Discussion\\}
This software development project was first time for all of our team members. So, we expected that our project could encounter a lot of adversities. And it was actually tough more than we expected. And there were so many unexpected challenges we’ve met. But of course, we have learned a lot of things from that challenges. We could understand how the software development process goes and how many problems that could possibly happen during the process.

At the very beginning of the project, we had problem to decide our program to develop. There were so many ideas. So negotiation was not that easy. After we decide what to develop, there were many problems we had to handle. So, we tried to meet as frequent as possible. However, we could not avoid communication problem. When our team members had meeting, we drew blue print of program and decide who has responsible for what. But we could not decide every implementation details and design. So, we had to contact each other to negotiate and how to achieve each member's job and how to integrate each member's code. 

Second hardship was using open source algorithms. At first, we thought that using open source code must be easy. Because we thought that if we need some feature and there is a open source code which implements our feature, we can just copy and paste it to our code. But if we do that so, there were so many errors. We had to modify source code to make it work together smoothly with other features.

Third hardship was related to hardware issue. We used hardware called LeapMotion to get data from hands. However leap motion camera was not good as we thought, so it was very hard to get accurate data. So, we had to apply SVM machine learning algorithm to improve accuracy. Using SVM algorithm was also big challenge for us.

Forth, we had an problem with Java. Not because of Java itself, but the problem was our low experience with java. So, we had to study how JAVA works.

Lastly, we didn’t have experiences working together with other people on one project. And making one function was kind of easy but integrating them and make them work together was harder than we thought.
Also, there were valuable experiences despite these hardships.

First was we could learn Java. We didn’t have any experience with Java before this project. For now, we have learned a lot of things about JAVA and software development.
Second, implementing small feature was relatively easy. However integrating them and make it work together without error was extremely hard. It requires not only coding each feature properly but also proper structure of program.
Third, we learned how to make GUI. Before this project we thought that making GUI was easy. But in reality, it was not that easy to implement detailed implementation. So, we use a lot of tools to help us like 'Jigloo' and 'Swing-Worker'.
